# Lab 04 - Versioning on S3

1. Using the bucket already created, let's activate *versioning*. To do this, access the bucket and click on **Permissions**.

2. Some options will appear. Click on **Version Control** and enable this option as shown in the images below.

3. Then go back to the bucket home page and upload a TXT file with some written text. Follow the step-by-step instructions to upload the file, as done in Lab 03.

4. After uploading, go back to the bucket page and see if the object is already available. Modify the permission and place the object public, as in Lab 03, and access its URL. The content of the object must be shown on the page, as shown in the following image.

5. Then change the content of the TXT file on your computer and keep the same name. Upload it again, to the same bucket.

6. After re-uploading, click on the object and, in the next window, click on **Latest version** and confirm that both versions of the object are available.

7. Copy and paste the object's URL again, or simply refresh the page that accessed the object before. As a result, the object's contents must be updated.

8. In the menu on the right side of the object, by clicking on "Latest version", you can download any saved version or delete any version.
