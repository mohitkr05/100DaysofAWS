## About this series

So I have decided to work on AWS for 100 days continously and record my journey.  

This repository contains a structured learning path designed to help learners progress from beginner to advanced level in AWS. 
The path is divided into 101 days, with each day containing a set of tasks and challenges that build on the previous day's concepts.
The repository includes a variety of resources, including tutorials, exercises, videos, and sample projects, that cover a wide range of AWS services and features, including EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, and more.
