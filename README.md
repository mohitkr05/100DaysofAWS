# 100 Days of AWS (100 दिन AWS के | शतंदिवस: AWS)

Welcome to the 100 Days of AWS series, which is about learning something new about AWS every weekday. Tweet with the tag \#100DaysofAWS

## About this series

So I have decided to work on AWS for 100 days continously and record my journey. This would be a bit different then the journey of other Youtubers.

First and foremost, this journey will be available in Hindi (and sometimes in English) videos.

This repository contains a structured learning path designed to help learners progress from beginner to advanced level in AWS. The path is divided into 100 days, with each day containing a set of tasks and challenges that build on the previous day's concepts.

The repository includes a variety of resources, including tutorials, exercises, videos, and sample projects, that cover a wide range of AWS services and features, including EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, and more.
