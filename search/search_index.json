Which of the following is the MOST important factor to consider when selecting an AWS Region?<ul> <li>A. Proximity to your end users</li> <li>B. Number of available Availability Zones</li> <li>C. Cost of EC2 instances</li> <li>D. Availability of specific AWS services</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Explanation: While all the options are important factors, for high availability,  having a sufficient number of Availability Zones (AZs) within a Region is crucial. This allows you to distribute your resources across AZs to minimize downtime from isolated failures.</p> <p>Topic: AWS Availability Zones</p> <ol> <li>An Availability Zone (AZ) failure disrupts a production database hosted on Amazon RDS. To ensure high availability, what is the recommended recovery action?<ul> <li>A. Manually failover the database to a secondary instance in another AZ.</li> <li>B. Re-launch the database instance in the same AZ.</li> <li>C. Restore the database from a recent backup.</li> <li>D. No action needed, RDS automatically recovers within the AZ.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Explanation: Option A is the best course of action. RDS offers Multi-AZ deployments where a standby replica resides in a different AZ. During an AZ outage, you can manually initiate a failover to the healthy replica for minimal downtime.</p> <p>Topic: AWS Outposts</p> <ol> <li>Your company requires low-latency access to on-premises resources for a critical application.

Vulnerability Scanning - Use Amazon Inspector to scan for vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.  - Use AWS Security Hub controls to monitor against best practices and security standards. Storage - Understand implications of root device type for data persistence, backup, and recovery.  - Use separate EBS volumes for OS and data (data volume persists after termination).  - Use instance store for temporary data only (data is deleted when instance stops/terminates).  - Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots. Resource Management - Use instance metadata and tags to track and identify resources.  - Be aware of and plan for service quotas.  - Use AWS Trusted Advisor for recommendations on cost savings, performance, and security. Backup and Recovery - Regularly backup EBS volumes with snapshots and create AMIs for future deployments.   - Deploy critical components across multiple Availability Zones and replicate data.  - Design applications to handle dynamic IP addressing.  - Monitor and respond to events.  -  Have a failover plan (manual or with EC2 Auto Scaling).  - Regularly test your recovery process. Networking - Set the time-to-live (TTL) value for applications to 255 (IPv4 &amp; IPv6) to avoid reachability issues. <p>practice-test</p>"},{"location":"notes/02_EC2/ec2-regions-cli/","title":"Ec2
